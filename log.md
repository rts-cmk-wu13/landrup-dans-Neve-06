## Summary Day 1. 
Today was the start to the project. Setting it up with Next, installing dependencies like sass, zod, etc. 
The big thing that was made today was the Login page, which works with a username instead of an email, 
and the hero component, which is a simple image. The Layout is also working, with a subgrid. 
More stuff will be added tomorrow.
