## Summary Day 1. 
Today was the start to the project. Setting it up with Next, installing dependencies like sass, zod, etc. 
The big thing that was made today was the Login page, which works with a username instead of an email, 
and the hero component, which is a simple image. The Layout is also working, with a subgrid. 
More stuff will be added tomorrow.

## Summary Day 2. 

Today was a difficult day. A lot of fetches didn't work, and i ran into a lot of problems with the activities list and details pages, where the data simply wouldn't show up. I only managed to get the list to work, but the details must wait for tomorrow. I did also create a profile page which you go to after the login page. I also made a lot of work on the landing page, like a component for the groups that are there. 
Tomorrow i hope for an easier time with this api. 

Also i cant be bothered to write every single commit like i did yesterday.

## Dag 3

Morgen - (tidspunkt)  

10:17 - First commit of the day, i installed embla carousel, for the landing page
Eftermiddag - (tidspunkt)

10:55 - I tried to install embla carousel, to see if i can make a good carousel. 

update: Its uh. Its not going too well

update: it went better i guess. yay. 

13:55 - Most of the successful stuff for today has been the styling. I also just got the details to work, and the proxy works too as well as no access.  

13:58 - A lot of different files, components and pages were made today but some work and some dont. 

## Summary Day 3. 

So basically all the stuff that i got to work today, was the stuff that tells me when something doesn't work. I got details and list to work fully, as well as getting a Notfound and no-access page to work. A carousel is also something i am planning to work on. Hopefully the next day will be better with more progress
